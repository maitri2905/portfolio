But with advancement in the field of Medical Science, vaccines with up to 95% accuracy have been discovered. However, this makes it difficult for vaccine producers to create generic vaccine due to the newer strains that are growing up in various parts of the world. </p></br>
<p><b>Note:</b>The main aim is not to extensively study the havocs caused by Covid in different countries through the last one year, that is already been done by so many great blogs out there.

I'll focus on analyzing the second wave in some countries along with the extent of vaccination.</p>

           <p>If we take data from most countries around the world into consideration then:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Covid kept infecting more and more people until mid January 2021- sometimes the slope is steeper like October-January , at times it is also levelled like August-October.</li>
<li>After January 2021, the curve finally started a downward shift as the daily new cases kept reducing.</li>
<li>At February the curve started an upward transition again and most of the world(or countries that contribute majorly to the population of the world) experienced what we'll call a <b>Second Wave</b>.</li>

<li>The recent second wave in India is quite prominent as the spike is huge.</li>
<li>The United States has a stable and relatively low number of daily cases since it's peak in January.</li>
<li>Brazil and France also had a second wave, which isn't very clear from the graph. We'll analyze them seperately below.</li>

          <ul>
            <li> The United States recieved it's peak(of the first wave) in daily cases in mid August 2020, when the count was about to touched hundred thousand new cases in a day.
</li>
            <li> After this the sloped started a downhill ride almost as steep as the increase from April 2020-July 2020.</li>
            <li> Around mid November 2021, the curve started a gradual then later a steep increase in daily cases.</li>
            <li> On January 24 2021, the daily cases are ~243k, which is almost more tham thrice the cases during the first peak in Mid July.</li>

<ul>
            <li> The curve for active cases mostly follows similar trends as the plot above it, except it's much more smoother.
</li>
            <li> The count for active cases in January is 1.49 million, almost 4 times the active cases during the peak in mid July.</li>
            <li> The curve for daily new deaths is more spiky and irregular.</li>
            <li> The number of daily deaths reported on January 16 2021 are 3585 and it is way above the usual limit.</li>
            <li> It is worth noting that on April 6th the daily death toll is 996, which is not more than 1.5 times the death toll during the peak of the first wave. </li>
            <li> The amount of vaccines being administered daily is also increasing rapidly, with periodic dips. Until now 147.5 million people have recieved their first shot and 97.1 million people are fully vaccinated. </li>

           <center><img src="img/t11.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="padding-bottom: 50px;" width = "600" height = "600"></center>

 <ul>
            <li> The curve for active cases mostly follows similar trends as the plot above it, except it's much more smoother.
</li>
            <li> The count for active cases on April 18 is 1.93 million, almost 2 times the active cases during the peak in mid September..</li>

            <li> The number of daily deaths reported on June 16 2020 are 2006 and it is way above the usual limit. It could easily be a typo.</li>
            <li>It is worth noting that on April 18th the daily death toll is 1625, which is not more than 1.5 times the death toll during the peak of the first wave.</li>
            <li> The amount of vaccines being administered daily is also increasing rapidly, with periodic dips. Until now 107 million people have recieved their first shot and 16 million people are fully vaccinated. These are people above the age of 45 as currently they are the only ones eligible. </li>

  
            <h5><b>So, what caused this catastrophic Second wave in India?</b></h5>
            <p> During late January and February when the daily cases in India reduced a lot, the people and even government officials made the mistake of assuming the worst was over. Despite seeing a second wave in European Countries, the possibility was ignored. Regulations on social-distancing and wearing masks were relaxed. People started believing that the population would develop herd immunity. Also, vaccines were considered sufficient in the battle against covid.</p>

<p>There are a lot more European countries that saw a second wave, I've chosen a subset of them here.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The second wave in these countries started much early around October-November unlike India and USA.  </li>
  <li> For all of these countries the second wave caused way more infections than the first wave and for some countries like France and Poland, cases during the first wave are almost negligible in comparison. </li>
  <li> Turkey's second wave came in late November, a little later than in other countries. After a decline later in January, the cases started increasing again in March and are still on the rise. The daily new cases in April are twice it's peak during December.Turkey possibly has a third wave.</li>
  <li>  The same goes for Germany, after the second wave subsided in February , the daily new cases are reaching a new peak again.</li>
  <li>Portugal on the other hand is a country, that brutally got hit by the virus during the second wave. After the peak in late January , the country has managed to bring back it's daily cases to as few as 200-300.</li>
  <li> UK follows a curve similar to Portugal. Although, the number of cases are much higher due to the country's population. The second wave started around late September. It is also worth noting that the highest recorded daily cases(peak) in UK was on January 8 2021 with 67,928 cases while for France it was on November 7 2020 with 88,790 cases. (This could be the highest for Europe)</li>

<ul>
  <li> During the second wave, even though France's daily new cases were almost 10 times than during the first wave, France kept it's daily death count to almost half this time. The country was able to cope better. </li>
  <li> For Germany and UK, the case was opposite, as the number of daily cases increased so did the death count which surpasses the average daily death count for the first wave. As we already saw, the infection cases in Germany are on the rise , but the death rate has gone down slowly. While for UK the curve for daily cases and daily deaths have both gone down a lot. </li>
  <li>Turkey on the other hand is not doing so well, along with the new cases rising every day, so is the death count.</li>
  <li> Portugal's death count after the second wave has almost reached zero.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's compare deaths per million population for these countries.</p>
 <center><img src="img/t17.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="padding-bottom: 50px;" width = "600" height = "600"></center>
<ul>
  <li>While most of the deaths in Portugal came from the second wave, it was the opposite for France.</li>
  <li>  Even though Turkey's mortality rate is comparitively low, if the same trend in daily deaths continue, we are going to see a rise in this too.</li>

  <p> It is clear, that some countries did well during the second wave, some didn't.</p>

<ul>
  <li> UK has a remarkably high vaccination rate. They have ordered more than 400 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines. Three have so far been approved for use:Oxford-AstraZeneca; Pfizer-BioNTech; and Moderna. Oxford-AstraZenca, one of the most widely used vaccine is made in different locations in Britain. You should check out this article for detailed analysis on vaccination in UK. </li>
  <li> Mostly UK has been giving first doses, around the last week of March it shifted focus from that to giving second doses. </li>
  <li> The vaccination curve for France, Germany and Portugal is following almost the same trend. France is doing a little worse in giving second shots of the vaccine. </li>
  <li>Turkey's curve has either been taking over or dipping below the general trend for the the remaining three countries.</li>
  <li> Turkey started vaccinating quite late in mid February. Initially, Turkey's rate of giving first vaccine shots was better than the three countries. </li>

  <center><img src="img/t19.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="padding-bottom: 50px;" width = "600" height = "600"></center>
  <center><img src="img/t20.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="padding-bottom: 50px;" width = "600" height = "600"></center>

  <ul>
    <li> The graph shows that on Thursday, there will be least Vaccinations </li>
    <li> The day which will have the Highest Vaccination is Friday </li>
    <li> Monday and Tuesday have almost same amount of Vaccinations. </li>
  </ul>

<h4 class="mb-5">Predicting the Total Vaccinations by next week</h4>

  <center><img src="img/t20.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="padding-bottom: 50px;" width = "600" height = "600"></center>
  <center><img src="img/t21.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="padding-bottom: 50px;" width = "600" height = "600"></center>

  <ul>
    <li> The graph shows that there will be a sudden increase in Total Vaccination from Tuesday to Wednesday.  </li>
    <li> On the other hand, the total Vaccination will gradually decrease by Saturday </li>
    <li> Sunday to Tuesday will have almost same amount of Total Vaccinations. </li>
  </ul>

<h4 class="mb-5">Predicting the number Fully Vaccinationed People by next week</h4>

  <center><img src="img/t22.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="padding-bottom: 50px;" width = "600" height = "600"></center>
  <center><img src="img/t23.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="padding-bottom: 50px;" width = "600" height = "600"></center>

  <ul>
    <li> The graph shows that the number of people that will be Fully Vaccinated would be increasiing from Sunday to Wednesday </li>
    <li> From Wednesday to Thursday, there will be sudden decrease in People Fully Vaccinated.  </li>
    <li> Till end of the week, the Number of people getting Fully Vaccinated would decrease. </li>
  </ul>

          <p class="lead mb-5">There are large datasets as some of the independent data are correlated with other data. First I tried using LASSO which uses L1 regularization( does the feature selection automatically) but the result was not accurate as LASSO cannot be used as it can only be used if we have correlated variables and it turns one variable to zero and retains only one variable. This was resulting in low accuracy for the model and loss of Information.</p>

<p class="lead mb-5">So, I used Ridge Regression as it reduces model complexity and it shrinks the parameters. 
It shrinks the parameters which result in reducing the variance
For the optimization function to be penalized, lambda regularizes the coefficients in a way that they(coefficients) take huge values. This was the more optimal method and we can prevent Overfitting using Ridge Regression.</p>
